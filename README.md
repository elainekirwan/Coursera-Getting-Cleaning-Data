## Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This Coursera programming assignment requires students to demonstrate their ability to 
collect, work with, and clean a data set within R. Using a combination of file download and 
data manipulation techniques we have been asked to create an R script (`run_analysis.R`) 
that does the following:

1.  Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set
2.  Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement 
3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.  Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names
5.  From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of 
    each variable for each activity and each subject


## Within this Repository
* README.md: Contains information about the other files in this repository
* CodeBook.md: Describes the variables, data and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data 
* `run_analysis.R` The R script which performs the transformation steps, producing the tidy data output
* tidyData.txt: A copy of the resulting tidy data set


## Data Set
For this assignment we are using the 'Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones' data set and
the zip file containing the test and training data and full details of the features and activities
is available at the link below:
